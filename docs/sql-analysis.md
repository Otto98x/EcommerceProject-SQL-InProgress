# SQL Code Analysis and Learning Reflections

## 1. Revenue Tracking Analysis

### Technical Functionality Deep Dive:
1. Common Table Expression (CTE) Usage:
```sql
WITH daily_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date) AS date,
        SUM(oi.unit_price * oi.quantity) AS revenue,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
    FROM orders o
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
    GROUP BY 1
)
```
- Creates a temporary result set for cleaner code organization
- Makes complex query more readable by breaking it into logical chunks
- Allows referencing the same derived table multiple times if needed

2. Window Functions for Moving Averages:
```sql
AVG(revenue) OVER(
    ORDER BY date 
    ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS moving_avg_7d
```
- Creates rolling calculations without self-joins
- ROWS BETWEEN defines the window frame
- ORDER BY ensures chronological calculation

3. JOIN Operations with Aggregations:
```sql
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date)
```
- LEFT JOIN preserves all orders even without items
- USING clause simplifies join condition when column names match
- GROUP BY with date truncation aggregates at daily level

### Business Logic & Value
- Creates daily snapshots of business performance
- Smooths out daily fluctuations through moving averages
- Tracks customer engagement alongside revenue

### For Non-Technical Stakeholders
"We're tracking how much money we make each day, how many different customers are buying, and looking at weekly and monthly trends. This helps us spot if our revenue is growing steadily or if we have unexpected spikes or drops."

### Improvements Needed
- Add error handling for NULL values
- Consider adding date range parameters
- Might need indexes on order_date for better performance
- Consider adding revenue targets for comparison

## 2. Purchase Pattern Analysis

### Technical Functionality Deep Dive:
1. Multiple CTEs for Data Transformation:
```sql
WITH customer_purchases AS (
    SELECT  
        o.customer_id, 
        o.order_date,
        SUM(od.unit_price * od.quantity) as order_value,
        LAG(o.order_date) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id 
            ORDER BY order_date
        ) as prev_order_date
    FROM orders o
    LEFT JOIN order_items od USING(order_id)
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
purchase_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        AVG(date_part('day', AGE(order_date, prev_order_date))) as avg_days_between_orders,
        SUM(order_value) as total_spend,
        COUNT(customer_id) as total_orders,
        AVG(order_value) as avg_order_value
    FROM customer_purchases
    GROUP BY 1
)
```

2. Advanced Window Functions:
```sql
-- LAG for previous purchase date
LAG(o.order_date) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_date
) as prev_order_date

-- NTILE for spending quartiles
NTILE(4) OVER(
    ORDER BY total_spend
) as spend_quartile
```
- LAG accesses previous row's data
- PARTITION BY creates customer-specific calculations
- NTILE divides customers into equal groups

3. Complex Aggregations:
```sql
SELECT
    spend_quartile,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_days_between_orders)) as avg_purchase_frequency,
    ROUND(AVG(total_spend), 2) as avg_total_spend, 
    ROUND(AVG(total_orders)) as avg_orders
FROM quartiles
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

### Business Logic & Value
- Groups customers by spending patterns
- Analyzes purchase frequency and value
- Identifies customer segments and behaviors

### For Non-Technical Stakeholders
"We're grouping our customers into four spending levels and understanding how often they buy, how much they spend per order, and how long they wait between purchases. This helps us identify our best customers and understand different buying behaviors."

### Improvements Needed
- Add comments explaining the quartile logic
- Consider adding seasonality analysis
- Might need to handle outliers better
- Add validation for negative values

## 3. Retention Analysis

### Technical Functionality Deep Dive:
1. Date Manipulation:
```sql
-- Creating cohort months
DATE_TRUNC('month', signup_date) as cohort_month,
DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as order_month
```
- Standardizes dates to month level
- Creates comparable time periods
- Enables cohort grouping

2. Complex Window Functions:
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
    PARTITION BY cohort_month 
    ORDER BY order_month
) - 1 as month_number
```
- Calculates months since first purchase
- PARTITION BY creates cohort-specific calculations
- Subtraction creates zero-based month numbering

3. Multiple CTEs Structure:
```sql
WITH cohort_base AS (...),
cohort_size AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as registered_count,
        cohort_month
    FROM cohort_base
    GROUP BY cohort_month
),
month_active_customer AS (...)
```
- Breaks complex logic into manageable pieces
- Creates reusable intermediate results
- Improves query readability and maintenance

### Business Logic & Value
- Tracks customer retention by signup cohort
- Shows customer loyalty over time
- Identifies potential churn patterns

### For Non-Technical Stakeholders
"We're looking at how many customers stick with us after they first sign up. For each group of customers who joined in a specific month, we track what percentage keeps buying from us over time."

### Improvements Needed
- Add filters for inactive customers
- Consider adding churn prediction
- Might need to handle seasonal variations
- Add more granular retention metrics (weekly/daily)
